# Coding test for Frontend Designer
As part of my application with Al Futtaim I created the following code in order to display the login form including validation.

As I am more a designer than a developer I choose to use jquery-validation for the validation of the form.

## dependencies
Make sure your computer has npm and gulp installed.

In order to install NPM go to: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
After installing npm run:
``npm install gulp --global``

## Install
1. clone the repository on your local computer or server.
2. run ``npm install`` to install the dependencies.
3. when npm finishes the installation run ``gulp serve`` to display the code in your browser.

Have fun with checking my code :)
